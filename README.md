# Globally Distributed High-Performance API

This project demonstrates how to build a fast, globally distributed API using Cloudflare Workers, HonoJS, Redis, and Next.js. The API is built for performance, scalability, and ease of use.

## Tech Stack

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless execution environment for globally distributed code.
- **HonoJS**: Lightweight web framework for building fast and modern web applications.
- **Redis**: Fast, in-memory database for quick data retrieval and storage.
- **Next.js**: React-based framework for building fast and modern web apps.

## Overview

This project leverages the following tools and services:

- **Cloudflare Workers** for serverless deployment of API endpoints that are distributed globally, ensuring low-latency access no matter where users are located.
- **HonoJS** as the web framework for building the API with a minimal footprint.
- **Redis**, via [Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/redis/), for caching and storing API responses for high-performance and scalability.
- **Next.js** for building any front-end components, if needed.
